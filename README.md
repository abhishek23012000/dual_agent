# Dual-Agent Knowledge API (CrewAI + FastAPI)

This project is a FastAPI-based web service that uses **CrewAI agents** to intelligently answer queries using both **public sources (Wikipedia)** and **private/internal documents (PDFs Quadrant)**.

The architecture is built to scale, modularize, and maintain a clean separation between logic, agents, and orchestration layers.
